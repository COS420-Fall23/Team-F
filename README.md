# Problem Statement

Problem Statement #1:

In an ever changing world,sometimes the advancement of technology causes people to not have high hopes for their future. One of the best examples for this is the introduction of Artificial Intelligence and robots which can potentially cause thousands of people to lose their jobs and has caused widespread distress and unease about the future. 
We’d like to propose a web application which will help people see the good in things rather than despair about a bleak future. The web application will help people find skills that will diversify their existing skill sets and help them apply for positions with various requirements. The website will not be a place where people apply for jobs, rather it is going to be something that will help uplift people’s moods by having various tips for improving mental health and proven guides to combat insecurity.
