# Problem Statement

Problem Statement #1:

Mental health has been one of the less discussed topics in the university where students suffer from mood disorders, general and social anxiety and depression. Academic pressure, financial stress, sleep deprivation, over-use of social media, relationship problems, and substance abuse are some of the key reasons for most of the college students to have mental health issues. Even though many universities have various dedicated departments and professionals that provide mental and emotional support , and therapy for students, most of the students who actually need mental health support are reluctant to use these services. Lack of awareness about these services, time constraints and fear of denial and bullying from friends and professors are some of many root causes students donâ€™t use the therapy services provided by the university. It is important for the university to encourage and help students to access and use various mental health support services offered by the university. 

UMaine has a dedicated counseling center webpage that provides information regarding various mental health resources available to the UMaine community. However, It may be overwhelming for someone who has never had mental health therapy to navigate to the right person to talk with. Additionally, as a college student with limited free time, it can be difficult to find time to meet with counselors. Students are currently unable to independently assess their mental health. A student that struggles with properly assessing their mental health will be less likely to know when an appointment is necessary, and less likely to receive needed treatment.
