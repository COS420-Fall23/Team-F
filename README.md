# Problem Statements

Problem Statement #1:

In an ever changing world,sometimes the advancement of technology causes people to not have high hopes for their future. One of the best examples for this is the introduction of Artificial Intelligence and robots which can potentially cause thousands of people to lose their jobs and has caused widespread distress and unease about the future. 
We’d like to propose a web application which will help people see the good in things rather than despair about a bleak future. The web application will help people find skills that will diversify their existing skill sets and help them apply for positions with various requirements. The website will not be a place where people apply for jobs, rather it is going to be something that will help uplift people’s moods by having various tips for improving mental health and proven guides to combat insecurity.

Problem Statement #2:

Mental health has been one of the less discussed topics in the university where students suffer from mood disorders, general and social anxiety and depression. Academic pressure, financial stress, sleep deprivation, over-use of social media, relationship problems, and substance abuse are some of the key reasons for most of the college students to have mental health issues. Even though many universities have various dedicated departments and professionals that provide mental and emotional support , and therapy for students, most of the students who actually need mental health support are reluctant to use these services. Lack of awareness about these services, time constraints and fear of denial and bullying from friends and professors are some of many root causes students don’t use the therapy services provided by the university. It is important for the university to encourage and help students to access and use various mental health support services offered by the university. 
UMaine has a dedicated counseling center webpage that provides information regarding various mental health support for the Umaine students, staff, athletes, and parents. Even though the counseling center has helpful information regarding their clinical staff and their services, it might be overwhelming for someone who has never had a mental health therapy and navigate to the right person to talk with. Likewise, as a college student with limited free time, it is difficult to schedule appointments with the right counselor without prior knowledge of the counselor availability that fits the student schedule. The counseling center webpage lacks a user-friendly self assessment tool that would better help students understand their mental health status and automatically help them suggest the right counselor. Having a user-friendly application rather than a static information page would encourage students to visit the counseling center and make it more accessible to anyone dealing with mental health issues.


# Communication Policy

- All written communication should be Discord. Zoom will be used for regular meetings with additional meetings having the option to be made in-person. 

- If a question is asked during a meeting, the person whose work most closely relates to it should respond. If no one responds the PM should do so, potentially assigning someone to respond. 

- If a question is asked in Discord it should be answered as quickly as possible, always within 24 hours. 

- Communication should either tag individuals or no one for most messages. Tagging the whole team may sometimes be appropriate.
